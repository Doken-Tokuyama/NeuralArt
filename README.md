# NeuralArt
Deep Learning for "Just as" painting styles

This tutorial can help you to use Neural Style transfer as described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576v2.pdf">A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style</a> by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker & Matthias Bethge.

We'll implement the neural style transfer algorithm by using the Tensroflow library.
